# SAd block
## Simple Ad Block
this is very simple to use system wide adblocking solution that:
- doesn't run in background u run it once and you're set
- for now works for every service
- is crossplatform 

i made it as my first go project hope you enjoy it 
also it uses hosts file to achive what it wants

to build from source do 
```
fyne-cross windows -app-id com.github.maksydab.sadblocker
fyne-cross linux   -app-id com.github.maksydab.sadblocker
```


<sub>Idk why it says update time in title bar its fixed in final version</sub>
